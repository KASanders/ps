        <h1>Digital Edition of the <em>Spiritual Meadow</em> (in progress)</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>John Moschus (<em>fl.</em> 6-7th c. CE) traveled around the Mediterranean
          interviewing monks, nuns, desert fathers and mothers, scholars, mimes,
          merchants, soldiers, and prostitutes. By turns riotous and harrowing, the stories
          collected in his <em>Spiritual Meadow</em> often bear a taste of the absurd,
          while opening an invaluable window into the lived experience of diverse
          peoples in Late Anqituity.</p>
        <p>As today the text of the <em>Meadow</em> is largely inaccesible, this site
          aims to produce a digital edition. Currently, only a small sample of
          stories are available (roughly 5%) and the text (of Migne's <em>Patrologia Graeca</em>)
          contains many dubious readings. Therefore, besides the completion of encoding, further goals,
          which are currently the subject of collaboration between students and faculty at The University of the South in Sewanee, TN, include the
          collation of several manuscripts and the production of an app crit. Interactive indices
          and integration with mapping platforms will add further layers of visualization</p>
        <p>The Greek text was created with Optical Character Recognition technology.
          It is encoded according to TEI/Epidoc standards and uses the CapiTains
          framework, which implements the CTS citation scheme that was originally
          designed for the Homer Multitext Project. Integration with the Alpheios project allows
          users to parse any word in Greek or Latin by double clicking on the word.</p>
