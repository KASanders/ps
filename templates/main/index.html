        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Moschus">John Moschus</a> (<em>fl.</em> 6-7th c. CE) traveled around the Mediterranean
          interviewing monks, nuns, desert fathers and mothers, scholars, mimes,
          merchants, soldiers, and prostitutes. By turns hilarious and harrowing, the stories
          collected in his <em>Spiritual Meadow</em> often betray a taste for the absurd,
          while opening an invaluable window into the lived experience of diverse
          peoples in Late Anqituity.</p>
        <p>As the text of the <em>Meadow</em> remains largely inaccesible and unknown, this site
          aims to produce a digital edition. Currently, only a sampling of
          stories are available (roughly 30%), and the source text (<a href="https://archive.org/details/patrologicursus97migngoog/page/n36">Migne's <em>PG</em></a>)
          contains many dubious readings. Further goals include the collation of several manuscripts and the construction of an app crit. Interactive indices
          and integration with mapping platforms will add additional layers of visualization.</p>
        <p>The Greek text was created with <a href="https://ancientgreekocr.org/">Optical Character Recognition</a> technology.
          It is encoded according to <a href="https://wiki.tei-c.org/index.php/EpiDoc">TEI/Epidoc</a> standards and uses tools designed by <a href="http://capitains.org/">CapiTainS</a>
          in order to implement the <a href="http://cite-architecture.github.io/cts/">CTS citation scheme</a>. Integration with the<a href="https://alpheios.net/"> Alpheios project</a> means
          that any Greek or Latin word highlighted by readers will be defined and parsed in browser via a pop-up.</p>
        <p>This site was built according to the CapiTainS <a href="https://github.com/Capitains/tutorial-nemo">Nemo Tutorial</a>.
           Many elements of the layout, templates, and design were borrowed and modified from <a href="https://github.com/classnum/mnemosyne">Mnemosyne</a> by Aur√©lien Berra.</p>
